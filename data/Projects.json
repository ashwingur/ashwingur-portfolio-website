    "description": "I have developed a new backend for my website. Initially, I used the backend provided with Next.js, but I wanted to expand my backend capabilities and host my owndatabase. I have set up an Ubuntu server on DigitalOcean. The application runs in a Docker container for easy configuration when working between my local and remote environments. A Flask server has been set up, using Gunicorn for the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), and a Caddy web server for HTTPS. The database is PostgreSQL with the TimescaleDB extension for optimal querying of time-series data. The server also features custom rate limiting on each endpoint with a Redis database, and authentication capabilities for accessing protected routes. Additionally, there are apps that allow for websocket connections to enable fast communication.",
