      "The first 3 books were decent. It's set after the Heroes of Olympus events so there's plenty of references and interactions with characters we already know about. I think those were the best part of the series. The concept of a god becoming an immortal and losing all his powers was interesting, however I didn't find the character of Apollo that likeable. The same goes with the other Protagonist, but I do give credit for putting a demigod of Demeter in the spotlight which some really unique plant abilities which we didn't see in previous series. He was quite annoying at times by being a little too incompetent. I wasn't interested enough to read the last book but the cameos from characters we already know about were the best, such as Percy and Leo and how they're going on with life after the huge events in the Heroes of Olympus series."

Although I wouldn't say the book has really complex plots, it is really enjoyable to read as the character and world building is still really great. Sometimes good versus evil is enough to be entertaining. The main protagonists and other point of view characters are all really likeable and unique in their pesonalities. I also like the focus on how all the races view the world very differently, especially the political and cultural behaviours. I felt like I had gone on one enormous journey and grown alongside the characters as they overcame their struggles and weaknesses."

      "A prequel to the main ASOIAF series, this book consists of 3 novellas about the adventures of 2 characters. The great thing is that this book does well as a standalone series, while only being set in the Game of Thrones universe. It's great to see characters dealing with more 'local' problems rather than being overshadowed by a greater plot that will affect the entirity of Westeros. However, there is still plenty of references to famous houses and events that readers will know from the other books which also adds to the immersion in the world. It's also considerably smaller and less dense than the ASOIAF books which also makes it an easy read that takes less time to digest the plot."

This is definitely a very challenging read that tackles some really fundamental human experiences in a complex way. I did find myself a lot of the time having to re-read paragraphs to really try and understand what was happening and sometimes I was not able to figure it out. But I think this may have also been part of the author's intention, to not explain every single bit of lore in the world but provide enough information to picture the world for ourselves.",

I had to search online for summaries and explanations just to understand the basic premise. I wasn't able to finish the 3rd book which is where I left the series due to the sheer challenge of understanding it. The first book was the best as I could still follow along, but I'm not giving it as high of a rating because of how difficult it is to read."

CGI Water is something that is extremely difficult to get looking realistic and in this movie it makes the world and universe seem completely realistic. Although the story was not as engaging (might have dragged on a little too long towards the end), it was still good and made up for by the cinematography. I would still watch all the future movies just for the visuals, even if the story isn't perfect."

      "By far the best movie i've ever watched and was lucky enough to have viewed it on IMAX for the first time. I really enjoy the sci-fi genre and coupling that with an emotionally deep story was amazing. What really makes the movie in my opinion is the score by Hans Zimmer, it makes every moment infinitely more immersive and intense. It took me a couple of watches to realise that the focus of the story is actually on the love between a father and daughter surpassing time and space. I believe this is what gives the movie lots of rewatchability and meaning. This does not however retract from the overall plot of the story which is embarking on a quest to save humanity."

So the plot twist that happens in the middle of movie took me by complete surprise and made me question just how much of the narrative was a hallucination by the Protagonist. It's interesting to see how the mental issues are illustrated and the way it affects the main character and the people around him."

It's also interesting to notice how my view of Greg changed as I grew older. I used to root for Greg a lot because of how he portrayed himself always being in the right and that everything that happened to him was unjust and unfair. But later on you realise he's quite an unrealiable narrator and sociopath. Especially in how he treats and views others even if they're just being reasonable."

Those earlier seasons were very well adapted despite the extreme complexities of the plots in the books. They did of course have to cut down on details in order to keep the seasons of a reasonable length. Season 4 was definitely the peak. I think it starts going downhill when the showrunners diverged from the book content or ran out of books. The characters became very 1-dimensional and often lost all the development they had gone through. Jaime is a great example of this."

Playing on a multiplayer server with friends is the best part of this game. Being able to build bases together and share resources.

It's interesting to see how a movie can be told in a reverse yet still linear order. Furthermore the characters who we initially believe to be the most suspicious end up being less suspicious as we go back in time which shows how the supposed protagonist spirals into a loop of feeding himself misinformation. The plot twist involving Sammy Jenkins also reminded me of Shutter Island, and how we the viewers also fall into the lies the unrealiable main character has created."

      "This was on my to-watch list for quite a while after seeing all the meme templates from this movie. The movie felt more and more disturbing as it went on until the eventual climax. I think there's 2 main interpretations of this movie which make some sense. The first is that all of the crimes committed is just a hallucination of Patrick's mind and the notebook in his office is the only indicator of his thoughts that others can see. However I think the 2nd scenario is more plausible where everyone knows about the murders which do occur. However, everyone is too preoccupied with their own lives, problems and reputation to deal with it so they purposely ignore Patrick's Behaviour. Overall this movie definitely left a lasting impression and is worth a watch (although probably not if you want something that's relaxing)."

This movie is very much focused on the perspective of Oppenheimer rather than the atomic bomb being the main focus. Almost all the scenes were dialogue heavy and involved many different characters and figures of history. These interactions were extremely engaging and it was cool to see it from the perspective of Oppenheimer which involved many of his visions/hallucinations. My only regret is not being able to watch this in 70mm IMAX projection as the Sydney one is still under construction. A minor issue I had was not being able to understand the dialogue sometimes due to the background music, however this didn't impact the experience too much as it was not that frequent."

          "This was my first experience with Brandon Sanderson's writing and I can confidently say that this book had me very engrossed from the start. The world building in this book was very solid and the mysteriousness of the world makes me want to find out more. It's set in quite an unusual premise where the 'Dark Lord' actually won. It combines this with a Master-Apprentice, heist plot which was very unique from what I've read before.",
          "Compared to other fantasy books i've read before such as George RR Martin's ASOIAF I felt that this book was much less dense with detail and as such was 'easier' to get through (which isn't to say that it lacks depth). The right amount of information was given without boring the user and many promises that are setup throughout the book payoff quite quickly so there is a constant sense of progression.",
          "I believe that the well thought out magic system in this book, both Allomancy and Feruchemy makes the action scenes very intense and provides a lot of explanation on way the world works. The diversity of the abilities and differences between Mistings and Mistborns. But even with all this we can clearly see that there are indeed limits to what Mistborn and Mistings can do and so they are not completely invulnerable so there's still stakes.",
          "SPOILERS AHEAD",
          "When we first gained knowledge about the Lord Ruler and how he is immortal I was preparing myself to have 3 all books build up to the fall of the Lord Ruler. Little did I expect the Lord Ruler to get taken down within the first book. This was quite refreshing because the next books are then able to explore the aftermath of killing the Lord Ruler and really makes us question whether living under the tyranny of the Lord Ruler was actually the most stable option.",
          "The book is also able to seamlessly explore multiple perspectives. Even though Vin appears to be the main character, we also have Kelsier and his crew. Kelsier's character is great as it helps provide a sense of progression to Vin's growing abilities and it is because of his character that the Lord Ruler even gets taken down. His crazy idea of killing the Lord Ruler seems like it would have never worked, or at least get pulled off within the first book and that they would have to find another way for it to actually happen."

          "Spoilers from the earlier book.",
          "This book is very different from the first. Due to it primarily taking place in Luthadel only, it's much more politically oriented as it explores the aftermath of the Lord Ruler's death and how there is now a vacuum of power to be claimed. We see how trying to be the most honourable and honest king leads to further conflict in Luthadel as politics get in the way of actual leadership against the marching armies. It is great to see Elend's character explored in much more detail here and how unique his relationship with Vin is when both appear to be completely incompatible. Seeing how this relationship becomes strained later on in the book adds much more depth as Vin feels very alone without another fellow Mistborn who understands her well (until we learn more about Zane).",
          "Another huge plot point that I like is the fact that the Lord Ruler was not the biggest obstacle that the crew had faced and overcome. The real threat is the mysterious mist that threatens to destroy the world that the Lord Ruler was somehow holding back. This reminded me heavily of ASOIAF where there is lots of war and conflict between the seven kingdoms whilst the true threat to all of mankind beyond the wall is building. It is similar here where multiple kings are trying to claim the crown and capital whilst the mist is getting stronger by the day and already killing outskirt villages.",
          "The spy subplot had quite an unexpected yet satisfying payoff which also came out of nowhere. Like Vin, I was completely convinced that one of the crew members was indeed the spy and I had never suspected that it would be OreSeur himself based on the way he had begun assisting Vin towards the end of the book up to the fact that he betrays The Contract.",
          "Overall, I believe that whilst this book contained less action and pace compared to the first book it sets up the characters and conflict well going into the third book which I plan to read immediately after this."

          "After the build up of the first 2 books I have become very invested with the characters and I am also glad to see some more viewpoints being explored such as TenSoon and Spook. I really like how much more gray the character's past and present have become in this third book. For example, Elend becomes less like the ideal ruler he pictured himself becoming in the previous book when he first becomes king. He appears to become more and more like the Lord Ruler. It really makes me question the Lord Ruler being a purely evil person. As I find out what he did to save humanity and his reasons for it I begin to understand him more. Despite the objectively unfair system he has setup between Skaa and nobility, that system was able to create 'peace' and stability in the realm for a millenia before he was finally overthrown.",
          "Spook was a character I did not expect to be of much importance, much less a POV character but I was pleasently surprised. The way he's portrayed gives a fresh view on the world and how he struggles to find his place on the team. Furthermore this view is also able to make the religion of The Survivor seems genuinly real because of him doing the impossible and becoming an allomancer in a 2nd metal which should never have been possible.",
          "Sazed's character also has an amazing arc seeing as he is the only one on the crew who hasn't been able to get over the death of a loved one. The way it makes him question his entire purpose of remembering and discovering the religions of the world because none of them have seemed to help him is engaging.",
          "The plot and characters are brought together in a really satisfying ending where everything starts to make so much more sense, including minor details from previous books. One such example is Vin only being able to control the mists when she didn't have her earring on due to it being a hemalurgic spike. The concept of Preservation and Ruin adds quite a lot of depth to the world and somehow makes Rashek seem like a good person now, causing suffering for the greater good of the world.",
          "The final fight between Vin and the Inquisitors is one of the best action scenes i've read and it felt very epic especially after she gained the full power of the mist. This in addition to Elend's own fight against the Koloss with the help of the atium mistfallen soldiers was sick. It all came to a satisfying conclusion with Sazed's ascension which was a nice unexpected twist that made sense, and him finally discovering the true religion he had been seeking the entire time. His reset of the world builds a great foundation for future books and lore."

This book is much shorter and features some new characters that do not appear to be related to any previous characters. It's cool to see how the events of the previous era have become a sort of mythology and legend and how the church of Survivor has become a very popular religion. The story feels completely new with a wild west element however the concepts of allomancy and feruchemy are still highly relevant but used in a more creative way as we didn't see anyone other than the Lord Ruler usig them combined together. There is also no more Mistborn which I think is good as it balances out how strong they really were and make the stakes seem higher."

          "I definitely became more invested into this second era whilst reading this book. I think the big reason is the more direct references to Era 1 which is awesome to see from an outsider's perspective who views the earlier characters as legend. I enjoyed the Kandra making a return, especially TenSoon who I thought had died in the previous era as he removed his spike. MeLaan's character is also awesome and I like that the Kandra are able to embrance their personalities whilst living amongst humans without having masters. The morality of Harmony is also put into question as we realis that Sazed can't simply favour preservation and must keep everything balanced, thus setting up Wax's entire life to be his arm of Ruin. I also enjoyed Marasi's role in this book more as she strugged with her own problems without the constabulary setting but was able to perform well despite this."

The concept of being able to share metal minds with others without being a Feruchemist opens up a numerable amount of possibilities. This is especially the case with the masked humans that we discover to be living on the other side of the planet this entire time. Their developed technology and world views introduces a fresh perspective to the series that I enjoyed, even though it was mostly towards the end of the book.",
          "Another aspect of this book that was not expecting was the improved characterisation of Steris, who in the previous books just comes off as a mostly generic noblewoman with an affinity to being very organised. However, the events in this book demonstrate the usefulness of her character despite her lack of powers as her level of organisation and contingency plans helped with the team's success. It also creates more chemistry between herself and Wax after being comfortable with herself more than she was in Elendel where she was much more reserved.",
          "The ending, although I expected them to find the bands of mourning, was still satisfying. It characterised the Lord Ruler as a less evil person because of how he helped the people on the other side of the planet that no one else knew existed. MeLaan is also a likeable character and her abilities as a Kandra make for some versatile solutions to certain problems."

      "Now this is where the so called Cosmere really lifts off. I was definitely not expecting Kelsier to still be 'alive', and it was definitely a risky choice for Sanderson to 'revive' a dead character. However in this case I think it went very well. The book takes place parallel to the first Era until the very end. I think it's interesting to see how the Survivor's religion which I had known to be 'false' as I had witnessed Kelsier's death actually turned out to be right about the Survivor still being out there in the mists. More insight was given to the divine gods controlling the planet and their motivations. I especially liked the twists that Kelsier had to pull off to trick Ruin in the end, which was very fitting for his character. The landscape is also very unique, I imagined it as a sort of celestial mirror world. The final moments between Kelsier, Vin and Elend was awesome and it did help give more context to the conclusions of Era 1 and allow for some more interaction with the likeable characters.",

I will say it is evident that this was Sanderson's first novel as it feels a bit more rough when comapred to the Mistborn series which says a lot about his improved writing style. Despite this however, I saw myself enjoying the book quite a lot.",
      "The characters and plot was mostly simple when compared to Mistborn, but I was still rooting for the characters such as Sarene and Raoden which were very likeable. The premise of the story was very interesting and I loved the concept of using religious means to completely takeover another country instead of the use of bloodshed. I initially didn't look forward to Hrathen's POV chapters but he soon became one of my favourite characters due to the depth of his characterisation that involved a lot of internal conflict. I liked that he knew deep down his methodology has become more logical and less about fanatical faith. This conflict was a great contrast to Dilaf who eventually turned out to be the true antagonist which also led to Hrathen's redemption.",
      "The magic system is quite different from Mistborn and had me curious about its potential. Picturing the scenes of the magic being used was fun to imagine and seemed very epic, especially in the last 100 pages when the Sanderlanche occurs. The roughness of the writing will make me give it a lower review than I would normally, but I still highly recommend reading this book if you did enjoy Mistborn. I am looking forward to reading the sequel books as those are more recent and I am curious to see where Sanderson goes with the plot. (Also noticed the Hoid reference)."

      "The magic system in this world is even more unique than that of Mistborn and Elantris in my opinion. I love the concept of power in colour and the way breaths can be transferred between people and objects to perform various functions. Firstly is the various levels of heightening an individual can reach which is based on the number of breaths they hold. I like how this is used as a symbol for status as well as the functionality it provides. The more breaths a person holds the bigger their Aura as they are unable to hide it because of the colours around them brightening. The real utility comes in when breaths can be used to awaken other objects as if they were alive. Whilst this is quite overpowered it also has clear limitations that Sanderson defines, such as the higher number of breaths required to awaken certain materials, how close they are to being human and the command complexity. We learn more about the lore and mechanics of the breath further into the book, especially with Vasher who holds an incredible amount of knowledge that is explained to us in direct but engaging manner. Another aspect is the Lifeless beings who are different to awakened objects in their ability to follow more complex and dynamic commands, but in exchange the breath from them cannot be retrieved. The way that the magic system tied in with how the religions in this world are viewed was very interesting. Especially with the discussion of how the Hallendran gods are more valid as they can actually be seen and heard versus the Austrism belief of a more divine God whos presence exists in nature but is not tangible.",
      "One thing I found to really enjoy was the multiple perspectives that Sanderson was able to fit into this single novel. Each character had vastly different personalities and worldviews which led to an interesting dynamic as the plot built up.",
      "The main character of this book would be Siri. As the youngest princess of the Idris kingdom, she is suddenly thrust into an unknown world which we also lack the knowledge of and she has to face challenges that she was expecting her sister Vivienna to be preparing for. Unexpectedly, I found myself liking the chemistry she has with the God King who was hyped up to be a mysterious and merciless ruler who's word was final. As Siri navigates throught the court politics it was awesome to see her adapting to their ways from a point of no experience. Her overall development was closely tied with the God King and I looked forward to every chapter of hers. One thing I was not expecting was the plot twist with the Pahn Kahl scribes being behind the increasing tensions between Hallendran and Idris. I was thoroughly convinced just as Siri was that there was a conspiracy amongst the high priests of the God King that were the true ones in control of the brewing conflict.",
      "Vivienna's character was a stark contrast to Siri as she appears to be the perfect princess that is able to perform all duties. Her strong sense of devotion to the religion of Austrism also contributed to this image. Whilst initially I found her character to be boring due to this, that was soon turned around as she faced numerous challenges outside of Idris on the streets of Hallendran. The way she had to re-evaluate her assumptions about other people and realise her arrogance made for a satisfying character arc. This was further improved by the sudden betrayal of her mercenaries. I was definitely not expecting the double twist of Denth turning out to be loyal to someone else. Vivienna is able to finally find meaning and her place in the world as she embraces the breath she has and that the cruelties of Hallendran are exaggerated.",
      "Yet another character that was also completely different to the princesses was Lightsong. His chapters were also very enjoyable and provided a more laid back perspective of Hallendran, and the point of view of a supposed 'God'. We find that despite his apparent laziness and lack of belief in his own Godhood, that he cares a lot about stopping the conflict even though he does not want to get stuck in court politics. I found his ending as very redeeming when he discovers his true purpose in which he realises that he did indeed have a purpose in returning to the world.",
      "Vasher is the most mysterious character whose motivations remain a mystery throughout most of the book. Nightblood, the sword that he possesses, further intrigued my curiosity that Vasher was hiding a lot more than he was showing. Whilst he is not a completely good character in the way he deals with conflict, we see that deep down he has morals for the greater good and uses his mastery of Biochromatic breath to help Vivienna and to stop the conflict. When he reveals himself as Kalad, one of the 5 legendary scholars I found myself in even more awe of his character, especially when the God King himself bows down in front of him.",
      "Overall I would highly recommend this book for someone looking to get a taste of Sanderson's work because it fits perfectly as a stand alone novel whilst also having connections to the cosmere (Hoid :P). "
