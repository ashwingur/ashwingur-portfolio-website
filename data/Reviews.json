      "The first 3 books were decent. It's set after the Heroes of Olympus events so there's plenty of references and interactions with characters we already know about. I think those were the best part of the series. The concept of a god becoming an immortal and losing all his powers was interesting, however I didn't find the character of Apollo that likeable. The same goes with the other Protagonist, but I do give credit for putting a demigod of Demeter in the spotlight which some really unique plant abilities which we didn't see in previous series. He was quite annoying at times by being a little too incompetent. I wasn't interested enough to read the last book but the cameos from characters we already know about were the best, such as Percy and Leo and how they're going on with life after the huge events in the Heroes of Olympus series."

      "A prequel to the main ASOIAF series, this book consists of 3 novellas about the adventures of 2 characters. The great thing is that this book does well as a standalone series, while only being set in the Game of Thrones universe. It's great to see characters dealing with more 'local' problems rather than being overshadowed by a greater plot that will affect the entirity of Westeros. However, there is still plenty of references to famous houses and events that readers will know from the other books which also adds to the immersion in the world. It's also considerably smaller and less dense than the ASOIAF books which also makes it an easy read that takes less time to digest the plot. There is honestly nothing I can really fault with this novel which is why I'm giving it a 10."

      "This was my first time reading something by Stephen King. It is a collection of short stories that seemed like a good read in a short amount of time. I was surprised to learn that the movie Shawshank Redemption is based off a novella in this book. I was not able to get through the 3rd story which was 'The Body' and that was where I left this book. Overall the stories I did get through were excellent and engaging."

          "This was a surprisingly great story with a plot I did not expect at all. It started off pretty slow, but after some more interactions between the 2 main characters the story really kicks off. It's interesting to see how the relationship between the school kid and former Nazi devolves further and further into insanity. It reaches the point where both characters recognise the conflict they have but continue to commit more unspeakable acts until there is no turning back."
