      "The first 3 books were decent. It's set after the Heroes of Olympus events so there's plenty of references and interactions with characters we already know about. I think those were the best part of the series. The concept of a god becoming an immortal and losing all his powers was interesting, however I didn't find the character of Apollo that likeable. The same goes with the other Protagonist, but I do give credit for putting a demigod of Demeter in the spotlight which some really unique plant abilities which we didn't see in previous series. He was quite annoying at times by being a little too incompetent. I wasn't interested enough to read the last book but the cameos from characters we already know about were the best, such as Percy and Leo and how they're going on with life after the huge events in the Heroes of Olympus series."

Although I wouldn't say the book has really complex plots, it is really enjoyable to read as the character and world building is still really great. Sometimes good versus evil is enough to be entertaining. The main protagonists and other point of view characters are all really likeable and unique in their pesonalities. I also like the focus on how all the races view the world very differently, especially the political and cultural behaviours. I felt like I had gone on one enormous journey and grown alongside the characters as they overcame their struggles and weaknesses."

      "A prequel to the main ASOIAF series, this book consists of 3 novellas about the adventures of 2 characters. The great thing is that this book does well as a standalone series, while only being set in the Game of Thrones universe. It's great to see characters dealing with more 'local' problems rather than being overshadowed by a greater plot that will affect the entirity of Westeros. However, there is still plenty of references to famous houses and events that readers will know from the other books which also adds to the immersion in the world. It's also considerably smaller and less dense than the ASOIAF books which also makes it an easy read that takes less time to digest the plot. There is honestly nothing I can really fault with this novel which is why I'm giving it a 10."

This is definitely a very challenging read that tackles some really fundamental human experiences in a complex way. I did find myself a lot of the time having to re-read paragraphs to really try and understand what was happening and sometimes I was not able to figure it out. But I think this may have also been part of the author's intention, to not explain every single bit of lore in the world but provide enough information to picture the world for ourselves.",
      "After the first book is where it got extremely difficult to follow the plot and plans of all the different characters. I had to search online for summaries and explanations just to understand the basic premise. I wasn't able to finish the 3rd book which is where I left the series due to the sheer challenge of understanding it. The first book was the best as I could still follow along, but I'm not giving it as high of a rating because of how difficult it is to read."

CGI Water is something that is extremely difficult to get looking realistic and in this movie it makes the world and universe seem completely realistic. Although the story was not as engaging (might have dragged on a little too long towards the end), it was still good and made up for by the cinematography. I would still watch all the future movies just for the visuals, even if the story isn't perfect."

      "By far the best movie i've ever watched and was lucky enough to have viewed it on IMAX for the first time. I really enjoy the sci-fi genre and coupling that with an emotionally deep story was amazing. What really makes the movie in my opinion is the score by Hans Zimmer, it makes every moment infinitely more immersive and intense. It took me a couple of watches to realise that the focus of the story is actually on the love between a father and daughter surpassing time and space. I believe this is what gives the movie lots of rewatchability and meaning. This does not however retract from the overall plot of the story which is embarking on a quest to save humanity."

However the thought required to understand the movies makes it extremely enganging. I especially like the protagonist of the movie, whose name we also don't know and goes by 'The Protagonist'. The action scenes were amazing because I could never have visualised how a fight between 2 beings going in the opposite direction of time could work."

      "This was an enjoyable movie to watch, and I went in without any knowledge of what it would be about. So the plot twist that happens in the middle of movie took me by complete surprise and made me question just how much of the narrative was a hallucination by the Protagonist. It's interesting to see how the mental issues are illustrated and the way it affects the main character and the people around him."

      "This is definitely more for a younger audience which is when I used to read these books a lot. But I always enjoyed them because of how short and easy they were with great illustrations. It's also interesting to notice how my view of Greg changed as I grew older. I used to root for Greg a lot because of how he portrayed himself always being in the right and that everything that happened to him was unjust and unfair. But later on you realise he's quite an unrealiable narrator and sociopath. Especially in how he treats and views others even if they're just being reasonable."

      "This could have been a 10/10 show if the quality of the later seasons was as good as seasons 1-4. Those earlier seasons were very well adapted despite the extreme complexities of the plots in the books. They did of course have to cut down on details in order to keep the seasons of a reasonable length. Season 4 was definitely the peak. I think it starts going downhill when the showrunners diverged from the book content or ran out of books. The characters became very 1-dimensional and often lost all the development they had gone through. Jaime is a great example of this."

Although this was much more limited in features it was really fun playing LAN multiplayer. I later got the PC Java version on which i've had the most fun ever. Playing on a multiplayer server with friends is the best part of this game. Being able to build bases together and share resources. There are so many complex mechanics and an entire automation system which has infinite potential."

It's interesting to see how a movie can be told in a reverse yet still linear order. Furthermore the characters who we initially believe to be the most suspicious end up being less suspicious as we go back in time which shows how the supposed protagonist spirals into a loop of feeding himself misinformation. The plot twist involving Sammy Jenkins also reminded me of Shutter Island, and how we the viewers also fall into the lies the unrealiable main character has created."
